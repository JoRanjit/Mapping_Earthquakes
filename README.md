# Mapping_Earthquakes

## In this project we use Leaflet tool to create an interactive map which will show the earthquakes around the world in the past 7 days.

##### *The earthquake data was pulled from USGS Home page -> Earthquakes ->  Real-time Notifications, Feeds, and Web Services -> All Earthquakes link under the "Past 7 Days".*

### The map has the following lay-outs which user could pick based on their preference using the top tight menu:
    * Street map
    * Satellite map
    * Dark map
    * Night Navigation map
    
#### The map is capable of showing three layers of earthquake related information - which could be turned on or off using a menu on the top right side. 
###### Each earthquake is marked as a circle in a color corresponding to the earthquake's magnitude. A legend is added to the bottom right side for easy understanding of the colors and the corresponding magnitudes.


    * 1. First layer - shows all earthquakes around the world in the past 7 days :
        * user will be able to get additional information like :
              the magnitude of the earthquake and the location by clicking on the circle marker.

    * 3. Third layer - shows all major earthquakes with magnitudes 4.5 or higher as circles:
            * user will be able to get additional details like:
                the magnitude and the location by clicking the circle marker.
